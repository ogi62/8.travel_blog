      "postSection2": "Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria Officially known as Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, but often just referred to as La Boqueria, this covered public market in Barcelona originally dates back to the 1200’s.Labeled as one of the top food markets in the world, La Boqueria is not exactly an off the beaten path food destination in Barcelona. Roads and Kingdoms recently published an article about the history of the market and how, due to masses of tourism, it’s changing.La Boqueria is no doubt one of Barcelona’s most famous tourist attractions for some simple reasons: the fresh ingredients and cooked foods available are impressive and it’s a culinary icon of Barcelona.",
      "postSection3": "From beautiful fresh seafood to meats and jamon, to fruits and vegetables galore, to spices, nuts, and dry ingredients, you can spend hours browsing through the colorful walkways of La Boqueria.In addition to all the ingredients available there are dozens of tapas bars, and cafes and restaurants where you can stop for a delicious bite to eat.Knowing that the market would get very busy around the lunchtime hours, my wife and I decided to arrive at about 8 am in the morning, right as the markets opens, to try and beat the crowds. From our hotel located along Passeig de Gràcia, it took about 10 minutes to walk to the market.",

      "postSection1": "Mumbai street food is as exciting as it is mouthwatering.Not only do you have a chance to taste some incredibly flavorful combinations of ingredients, but standing along the humid streets of Mumbai, watching countless people go by, is part of what adds to your experience.In this blog post I’m going to share with you 10 of the best Mumbai street foods and also where to eat them.1. Vada Pav...If you take a walk down any street in Mumbai, you’re bound to quickly come across vada pav, one of Mumbai’s most popular and widely available street food snacks.Also referred to as the Mumbai vegetarian burger, vada pav consists of a spiced mashed potato mixture, which is deep fried into a patty, packed into a white fluffy bun, and garnished with a variety of different chutneys and spices for seasoning.Although it sounds rather simple, and it is, it’s one of greatest tasting vegetarian burgers you’ll likely ever eat. The chutney makes all the difference. And also, don’t miss those fried chilies on the side to give you a kick of heat and flavor.Where: Ashok Vada Pav serves one of the legendary versions of vada pav in Mumbai (supposedly the original), and it’s sensational.Address: Kashinath Dhuru Marg, Dadar, Mumbai (near Kriti College, Dadar)Open hours: 11 am – 9:30 pm on Monday – Saturday (closed on Sunday)",
      "postSection2": "2. Bhelpuri...Another Mumbai street food you’ll commonly find throughout the city, especially along the busy beaches like Girgaum Chowpatty and Juhu, is bhelpuri. Although it’s common around India now with many variations, bhelpuri is one of the homegrown Indian snacks from Mumbai.The basic recipe includes puffed rice and sev, which are mixed together with potatoes, onions, tomatoes, again a variety of chutney, and it’s often topped with a handful of chopped cilantro. The result is a crunchy snack that’s tangy, spicy, and sweet from all the sauces, with a wonderful balance of flavor. It’s the type of Mumbai street food that once you start eating it, you can’t stop.Where: I tried the bhelpuri in the video at Juhu Beach Food Centre at a place called Om Sai Sagar Chaat Centre.Address: Juhu Beach Food CentreOpen hours: 10 am – 1 am daily",
      "postSection3": "3. Sev Puri ...Chaat is a word that is used to describe a huge variety of mostly savory snacks in India, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there were thousands of different types of chaat. I’ve eaten a few of them, and one of my personal favorites so far is Mumbai sev puri.Sev puri begins with a flat puri, which is essentially a little round chip, topped with mashed potatoes, onions, cilantro, sev, and a trio of garlic, tamarind, and chili sauces to give it an incredible balance of flavor. Finally, sev puri is topped with a handful of sev, as the name suggests, and also sprinkled with little bits of green sour mango.Take a full bite of sev puri, and the flavor explosion will overwhelm your mouth and it may just turn out to be on of your favorite Mumbai street food snacks as well.Where: I found 6th Road Sev Puri on Foursquare, and since I was in the area I had to give it a try. Turned out to incredible.Address: On the corner of Indravadan Oza and 6th road, very close to Juhu Beach.Open hours: Not totally sure of their hours, but I think they open starting around 4 pm in the afternoon.",

      "postSection1": "Here’s what happened.I get a message from my friend David – The Hungry Tourist.He’s one of the most genuine food and people lovers, as well as food connectors, that I know – and he’s at the top of his game when it comes to the best of the best, and the ultimate quality of everything he eats.In the message, David said something along the lines of:I’ve organized a food pop-up that’s going to include the BEST Kobe beef and sushi from Japan, flown down to Phuket at Sri Panwa hotel, can you make it?”A day later, my wife and I were on a flight from Bangkok to Phuket.It was the food opportunity of a lifetime!We arrived to Sri Panwa, located on a southern cape of Phuket, it’s known to be one of the most exclusive hotels in all of Phuket.Since Sri Panwa is so hilly, you are transported from building to building by little mini trucks, like oversized tuktuks. It adds to the experience.After checking in, we settled into our garden villa.The room was clean and modern, being semi-minimalist, while having everything you could possibly need and more, all within the villa.One of the best things about the villa: The private swimming pool, and not just any swimming pool, but a saltwater swimming pool. I sat in the pool for hours at a time without my eyes ever hurting from any chlorine.So the way the food pop-up worked is that it took place for 2 nights, so the first night was sushi, and the second night, Kobe beef. My excitement was at a peak.Before our sushi meal, which little did I know would be the best sushi meal I’ve ever had and give me a new perspective on sushi, I met up with David at Baba Nest at Sri Panwa.Baba Nest is a world renowned rooftop bar, known for its views, which are nothing short of breathtaking.",
      "postSection2": "Master Sushi Chef Hiroyuki Sato.Master Sushi Chef Hiroyuki Sato is one of the most renowned and up and coming sushi masters of Japan.His restaurant in Tokyo, Sushi Tokami is a Michelin starred restaurant. In the Japan Times review of his restaurant, they mention that he demonstrates creativity and knowledge in choosing some of Japan’s finest fish.Also, Chef Hiroyuki Sato is just such a friendly nice guy.We sat down for sushi, and before I even knew it, chef handed me a tossaki (some part of tuna from the neck) minced in a hand roll with seaweed.The seaweed collapsed and was so crisp, the minced fish melted on my tongue like ice cream melts, and the rice was lightly soured to balance it.That was the beginning of 22 pieces of the best sushi I’ve ever had.The attention to detail, the temperature of the fish and rice (which is of huge importance), and watching Chef Hiroyuki Sato make each piece of sushi, and personally hand it to you, is what made it so special.We can’t cover all the courses here, or you’d be scrolling for days, but a few of my favorite pieces were all pieces of the tuna, from red meat (akami) to the fatty tuna belly (otoro), the baby snapper, sea urchin, and rosy seabass.I did not want the sushi to end, ever.",
      "postSection3": "Wagyu Mafia ... The crew that makes up Wagyu Mafia are originally wagyu / Kobe beef dealers (just to clear it up, Kobe beef is from the Tajima strain of wagyu cow – so Kobe beef is a type of wagyu cattle).Due to the demand for the beef they were buying, and their knowledge of wagyu beef, they decided to open an exclusive restaurant in Tokyo. They know Japanese beef better than just about anyone.Along with a variety of wagyu parts and pieces from cattle breeds directly from farmers they personally know, they brought an entire 3 kilo hunk of Kobe Beef A5 ribeye (best of the best quality).It was one of the most amazing things I’ve ever touched.In Japanese fashion, we enjoyed an omakase meal course, where the chefs serve you the best of the day.Although every wagyu beef bit of the entire meal stood-out to me, and was beef like I never had before, something I still can’t get over is the oyster blade Ozaki beef nigiri sushi.I can still vividly remember how it turned to liquid in my mouth without me even chewing.Then came the Kobe beef ribeye (Kobe Beef A5 BMS11).It was baked in a wood fire oven until the outside was dark and smoky but the inside was bloody and red.The beef was the purest, softest, and most flavorsome piece of meat I’ve ever tasted. It was immaculate and perfect, without the need of anything to enhance it.Again, an omakase sushi meal by Master Sushi Chef Hiroyuki Sato and courses of wagyu Kobe beef by Wagyu Mafia, were two of the most gourmet, high quality, and precise meals I’ve ever had.Both truly care about the ingredients they serve, and know how prepare them in a way that magnifies their natural tastes and textures.And on top of the amazing food, both Chef Hiroyuki Sato and the crew from Wagyu Mafia, are all just extremely friendly and fun to hang out with.",

      "postSection1": "Jerusalem is one of the world’s most fascinating cities… and it also happens to be an amazing place to eat.In this Jerusalem food tour post, I’ll give all the details about a few of the ultimate culinary gems to get a taste of this incredible city.Jerusalem food tourI had wanted to visit Jerusalem since I was a kid, and finally I had a chance.But along with some sightseeing, the main reason I wanted to visit Jerusalem was to eat, and see the incredibly loving people behind the food.I met up with my friend David from The Hungry Tourist (check out David for some amazing food), and Rafram, an expert on Jerusalem, and we set off to devour the ultimate food of Jerusalem in a single day.I’m going to share with you all the places we ate.Hummus AcramawiThere’s no better way to start the day off when you’re in this region of the world, than with a plate of hummus, pita, and fresh raw vegetables.Of every hummus I’ve ever had, this little family restaurant located on the outside of Damascus Gate of Old Jerusalem, is probably the best I’ve ever tasted.Hummus is relatively simple ingredient dish – chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, salt –  but what’s amazing, is that no two plates of hummus are the same. Every version tastes and feels different.The hummus in Jerusalem at Hummus Acramawi was a more fluffy version (rather than being too dense), and almost had a whipped texture to it.Additionally, the generous amount of olive oil made it perfectly moist without being too heavy and the lemon chili sauce is what elevated it to hummus perfection for me.Again, up until now, this is the best hummus I’ve ever had anywhere.Hummus Acramawi...Address: 2 Ha-Nevi’im, Jerusalem 9720301, Israel.Price: 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate",
      "postSection2": "Al-shuala Grill Restaurant...Just a short walk from Hummus Acramawi and you’ll find Al-shuala Grill Restaurant, known among food lovers to serve one of the best shawarma’s in Jerusalem.As you enter the restaurant you’ll be in awe of the gigantic rotating meat, slow roasting away and waiting to be shaved into your shawarma wrap.In addition to the meat being flavorful, the bread is a thin wrapper (similar almost to a Mexican flour tortilla or an Indian rumali roti).Al-shuala Grill RestaurantPrice: 26 ILS ($7.26)",
      "postSection3": "Al Baghdadi Kebab...Deep in the winding narrow lanes of East Jerusalem in the Old City, this piece of preserved history is a culinary gem. The owners family originally moved to Jerusalem from Baghdad.When we arrived, the owner began making his kebabs from scratch, seasoning the minced lamb with salt, pepper, parsley and onions, and chopping and mixing it at the same time by rocking a curved sword over the ingredients (you have to watch the video to see it).Additionally, he made one of the most memorable salads I’ve ever had – a combination of cucumber, tomato, and parsley, again, finely minced with the sword, and mixed with raw tahini.The kebabs, and the hand-made food love the owner showed to us was why this meal in Jerusalem was probably my favorite of the entire day.His hummus was also excellent and hand-made. It was more dense and sticky than the first version. Eating kebabs in Jerusalem is a food and people memory I’ll never forget.Price: 100 ILS ($27.89)      ",

They buy and source the beef themselves, do Kobe beef popups sometimes, and now have a flagship restaurant in Tokyo.For our opening night of the tour, we had an insane Kobe beef meal, that included steak, sukiyaki, Chateaubriand steak sandwich, and not forgetting Kobe beef gyoza. It was an unforgettable meal.",
      "postSection2": "Yakiniku at Nakahara....Nakahara was probably my favorite meal of the entire tour, a restaurant that’s rated as one of the top Japanese yakiniku restaurants in Tokyo.The Hungry Tourist had arranged for us to eat at the chef’s counter and the owner / chef cooked each bite of beef in front of us. One of his specialties are all parts of the wagyu tongue which was excellent, but the skirt steak and perfect wagyu cutlet sandwich were the courses that really blew me away.",
      "postSection3": "Shima Steak...We went a little overboard on Japanese wagyu beef, and I’m very ok with that.One more beef meal I just have to share with you is Shima Steak. At this unassuming family run basement restaurant in Tokyo, you’ll find premium Japanese beef, served western style, and it’s amazing.You can either order the fillet or the sirloin, I got the sirloin, and the chef trims your steak and grills it in his personally designed one of a kind steak oven grill.The steak is unbelievable!",

      "postSection3": "Best Time to Visit Belgrade Much like any other destination you visit, timing is everything when it comes to making the most of your 48 hours in Belgrade. When working out the best time to visit Belgrade, you need to factor in both the weather and when the high and low seasons are. This is because Belgrade experiences four seasons, but in a more extreme way than what you might be used to.High season in Belgrade hits during the months of July through September, with exhaustively hot days. Unlike other parts of Europe, Belgrade’s summers tend to linger through to September. Since this is outside of the typical European high season, it can be a good time to go if you are looking for warm weather.A better time to visit though is during shoulder season when good weather and lower tourist numbers make visiting more comfortable and affordable. In this case, look to visit during the months of April through June or even as late as October. Not so appealing however is traveling to Belgrade during winter, as even the occasional Christmas market can’t make up for short days and bitter cold.",
