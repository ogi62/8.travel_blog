But Belgrade is much more than just a place to party and drink. It’s a city with one foot in the past and the other in the present, making it an essential stop on a good Balkans itinerary.As the largest city in the Balkans and a destination full of character and culture, Belgrade is ideal for a Balkans city break.

      "postSection3?": "Best Time to Visit Belgrade Much like any other destination you visit, timing is everything when it comes to making the most of your 48 hours in Belgrade. When working out the best time to visit Belgrade, you need to factor in both the weather and when the high and low seasons are. This is because Belgrade experiences four seasons, but in a more extreme way than what you might be used to.High season in Belgrade hits during the months of July through September, with exhaustively hot days. Unlike other parts of Europe, Belgrade’s summers tend to linger through to September. Since this is outside of the typical European high season, it can be a good time to go if you are looking for warm weather.A better time to visit though is during shoulder season when good weather and lower tourist numbers make visiting more comfortable and affordable. In this case, look to visit during the months of April through June or even as late as October. Not so appealing however is traveling to Belgrade during winter, as even the occasional Christmas market can’t make up for short days and bitter cold.",
